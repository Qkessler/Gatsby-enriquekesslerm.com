üé∂ Maven music player Desktop App created with functionality that allows for xml
importing, and implemented with patterns from the GoF Design Patterns book.

All the code has been refactored in order to allow for a better code reading time
and easier reviewing in the future.

* Structure
The structure of AppMusic can be appreciated in the subsequent image:

* Functionality
If we had to give a functionality list it would be the following:

**  PersistenceüìÅ
The Persistence was configured using the H2 engine, which provides with the 
possibility to register entities, and allows for editing certain values of the
mentioned entities. The important information regarding the H2 documentation can 
be found at: 

- [[https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html][H2 official documentation]]
- [[https://github.com/h2database/h2database][H2 Github]]

**  UIüíª
The UI was created using the Swing Framework. Swing allows for different elements which
composes every "view". The views in our app are composed of JFrame, which may or may not
have different pannels inside, containing the relevant "Components". Examples of the views:

*** Search Songsüîç
You have the possibility to access the the search songs tab, which allows you to
access all the songs that have been persisted and play a certain one. You could also
play songs by double clicking them in this tab. The search possibilities are with the
following sections:

- Genre: Genres are calculated dinamically with the keys read while parsing the xml files.
- Artist: Search by the name of the artist.
- Title: Search by the name of the song.

*** Recent SongsüîÅ
The Recent songs tab is the default tab when you enter the app and contains the list of the
10 recently played songs. You could still access the media functionality.

*** PlayListsüîÉ
Following the functionality list, playlist functionality has been
implemented. While being a normal user, you have access to creation of ilimited
playlists (New Playlist Tab) and media functionality for your created playlists
on the My Lists Tab. 

If you upgraded your account (fictional upgrade), you would be applied a discount code
depending on defined codes being applicable. When multiple codes are applicable, the highest
discount is applied.

** Patterns

AppMusic was designed having the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns][Design Patterns book]] by Gang of Four in mind.

Starting with the patterns used, is the *MVC pattern*, which is creating a
Controller that asures that we have layer separation between models and UI
elements in the application. We also make use of the *DAO pattern*, which is
used to make the application independent of any persistence framework.

In order to implement the Discount functionality we use the *Strategy pattern*,
which allows for dynamic and execution time changing on the implementation for
Discounts. The Discount interface is defined, which will be implemented by
concrete Discount classes like "EducationDiscount" or "ElderDiscount".

The *Singleton pattern* is used in order to provide our factories ‚Äîwhich are
the classes that store the persisted elemements in HashMaps in order to allow
for faster access‚Äî with only one instance in the entire application, reducing
overhead by creation of objects. We use the implementation model of declaring a
getInstance method that checks whether the =instance= attribute is non-null and
returns it. If the instance is null, it calls the private constructor to create
the new instance.

Lastly, we use the *Observer pattern* so that our Controller can listen to any
possible changes on the Song Component, which provides a list of Songs that it
parses from an xml file. Any possible change in the list is notified to all the
listeners, which in this case is only the Controller.

** Development
This instructions will get you up and running for development purposes. See
Tests for notes on how to test the app and special requests on tests created.

*** Prerequisites
As you can see in the description of the project, we use Maven in order to
provide for easier control of the project, hence the need of installing
Maven. You can install it reaching the following [[http://maven.apache.org/install.html][link]] and reading the installing
steps for your OS distribution.

As a side note, we use ‚Äîin order to comply with instructions from professors‚Äî
the H2 persistence system, adapted to our course. You should be able to get it
googling for H2 server or use your own persistence framework, like SQLite3.

*** Getting up and running

#+begin_src shell
1. Fork this repository.
2. Clone the repo that you just forked, ‚ö† IMPORTANT to clone the repo that you just forked, not this one, you should go to your Github profile if necessary.
3. Checkout to the "dev" branch, at AppMusic we use GitFlow.

   git checkout dev

4. Create a new branch off the "dev" branch:

   git checkout -b <new_branch_name>

5. Run mvn install in order to install all the dependencies.

   mvn install

6. Open the persistence server.
7. Run the App class, which contains the main function for the application.
#+end_src



You are up and running! Enjoy!

** Tests

We use JUnit4 in order to provide tests to the application. Any functionality
that is pull requested should have the according tests in order to make sure
that everything is working and integrated correctly with other functionality.

Maven provides the easy =mvn test= command, which runs the test suite for the
application.
