#+SUMMARY: Starting the journey! This is the post where I keep all my progress on the 100DaysOfGatsby challenge.

Considering previous experience learning Python following a similar strategy, I
find that the 100DaysOf* is the best way to get proficient with any new
technology interesting enough! The 100DaysOfGatsby plan that Iâ€™m following was
created by the Gatsby team, you can find it here: [[https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/tags/100-days-of-gatsby/][100-days-of-gatsby]]

* Day 1: 2021/03/07
  The first day I created the repository and added the first project, starting
  to dabble with routing, using the [[file:../org_files/slip-box/20210314170333-gatsby_file_system_api.org][Gatsby File System API]] and graphql. I find
  that the graphql that was changed by Gatsby is a really interesting concept,
  with the ability to pass filters to the queries.

* Day 2: 2021/03/08
  The second day! I started trying to understand pages in Gatsby. Considering
  that it is the first time that I have touched React, Typescript and Graphql, I
  have a lot of learning to do.

  I understood the amazing way to pass variables to html code, all inside our
  javascript or typescript files! I also added the [[https://github.com/Qkessler/100DaysOfGatsby/blob/main/20210308183755-gatsby_building_blocks.org][Gatsby building blocks note]].

* Day 3: 2021/03/09
  On the third day, I started getting interested on Styling on Gatsby,
  considering that it was recommended to me to start thinking about theming and
  CSS-in-JS frameworks, namely Chakra-ui, Theme-ui and Tailwind CSS. I wrote
  a [[https://github.com/Qkessler/100DaysOfGatsby/blob/main/20210309171436-gatsby_styling.org][note]] on the topic, drawing from the information that I found on
  the [[https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/styling][how-to/styling]] page in the Gatsby documentation.

  I also tried implementing a simple navigation betweeen locations with the file
  system api, but I didn't seem to understand it correctly. More work to do.

* Day 4: 2021/03/10
   On the fourth day, I started working on getting content in the site, starting
   with the Contentful CMS, which was recommended by the Gatsby team for the
   simplicity and ease of mastering the concepts.

   I also added the location pages, but it doesn't really work because I still
   don't understand how to pafss the variables to the queries.

* Day 5: 2021/03/11
   I though that it was a good idea to check the =filesystem-api= to make sure
   that I was understanding the queries, just to see if I was doing stuff wrong
   with the Contentful API. Surprise, I was. the filesystem-api made working
   with the =src/= directory a breeze. I added the [[https://github.com/Qkessler/100DaysOfGatsby/blob/main/20210311190230-gatsby_data.org][Gatsby data note.]]

   I tried to set up the locations pages again, with no success.

* Day 6: 2021/03/12
   On day 6, I tried getting some information on fixing the Contenful API, it
   seems that I would never get this working. I looked at =StaticQueries= in the
   Gatsby docs. Still didn't work.


   I added the location page, getting the correct information into a list.

* Day 7: 2021/03/13
   On day 7, I added [[https://github.com/Qkessler/100DaysOfGatsby/blob/main/javascript-gatsby-emacs-configuration.org][Emacs development configuration]] in order to get a working
   react, gatsby and typescript workflow going!

   I also added the [[https://github.com/Qkessler/100DaysOfGatsby/blob/main/20210308181323-gatsby_static_queries.org][Static Queries note]], drawing on the information I had been
   collecting the day before.
   
* Day 8: 2021/03/14
   I added the [[https://github.com/Qkessler/100DaysOfGatsby/blob/main/20210314170333-gatsby_file_system_api.org][Gatsby file system api note]], trying to understand the process
   that Gatsby uses for getting the data to create the pages. The information
   turned out to be amazing, it is the first time that I see technology making
   use of queries from the file name.

   On the same day, I used some of that information to get information out of
   the filesystem-api, getting more pages working. I also found that there was
   no =gatsbyPath= property on graphiql for the ContentfulLocation object, which
   is key to linking to the pages created by the Gatsby file system api.

* Day 9: 2021/03/15
   I added a working proof of concept project, using what I had learned about
   the filesystem api to finally get the location pages working, feels amazing!
   I found that maybe it was a problem with the Contentful starter page,
   creating a new project worked wonders.

* Day 10: 2021/03/17
   As I finished the first task that was assigned by the Gatsby team on the
   100DaysOfGatsby blog post, I turned to the second challenge, which started me
   out on CSS frameworks, namely [[https://chakra-ui.com/docs/getting-started][Chakra-ui]].

   I found that the documentation for installing Chakra-ui is flawed, as there
   are a ton of dependency issues and the directions are a bit confusing.

* Day 11: 2021/03/18
   I worked a bit more on the emacs configuration, I wasn't really happy with
   =js2-mode=, and turned to =lsp-mode=, which is the package that I really use
   for all my programming needs inside of emacs. Here are interesting links:

   - [[https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/][lsp-mode package]].
   - [[https://github.com/theia-ide/typescript-language-server][typescript-language-server]]: useful for a ton of editors, which support json configuration.

   I also tried to get Chakra-ui working, but there was no way to get Gatsby 3.*
   and Chakra together. I found that some issues were created on the Chakra-ui
   repo, pushing for a change of versions or at least supporting both.

* Day 12: 2021/03/19
   On day 12, I added
   the [[https://github.com/Qkessler/100DaysOfGatsby/blob/main/20210319190110-style_guide_design_systems_and_component_libraries.org][Style Guide, Design Systems and Component Libraries note]], which is super
   interesting for understanding the world of styling and website making.

   I also added my web project, which is really the project I will be mostly
   working on, on this 100Daysofgatsby. I tried working with a custom navbar,
   didn't really find it interesting. I need to learn more
   about [[https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/conceptual/how-shadowing-works/][Shadowing in Gatsby]].
   
* Day 13: 2021/03/20
   I worked a bit more on the layout, running into a ton of errors, namely
   because Chakra-ui kept giving me war for the dependencies.

   I changed the starter project to the amazing [[https://www.huxiaoxing.com/building-a-website-with-org-mode-files][Xiaoxing's orgajs starter]], which
   is a package that gets the content for the site from org-mode files. I
   configured the options for the starter, getting some changes on the site
   always feels good.

* Day 14: 2021/03/21
   On day 14, I tried to swich from npm to yarn, as I found that yarn was much
   quicker and lighter, considering that I have to create a node_modules folder
   everytime I change machines. Didn't really work, I was running into
   dependency issues and couldn't find helpful information on the documentation.

   I restarted the project once more, considering that I had messed up the
   installation files from all the changes to yarn. I updated some of the work
   from previous days and started working on the header of the blog, trying to
   change the theme of it.

   I also changed the themeSwitcher's place, making it look a lot better in my
   opinion. Couldn't get sticky position working on the navbar using Theme-ui,
   need to inform myself better.

* Day 15: 2021/03/22
   This was more of a relaxed day, I tried to understand the logic behind the
   orgajs, which are the configuration files that I need to pass to headers and
   files in order to make it work. More information was found regarding:

   - Org-mode tags, which translates into tags to the blog posts, really cool.
   - Categories.
   - Closed dates: Orgajs could use the closed date on our published posts, man
     I love org-mode.

* Day 16: 2021/03/23
   I started trying to change the theme-ui colors for the header links, without
   success again, will have to add custom css-in-js to the =Link= tags it seems.

   The 16th day was amazing. I got to attend to a Gatsby cloud performance
   webinar, and added a note on the notes that I had been taking on the
   webinar: [[https://github.com/Qkessler/100DaysOfGatsby/blob/main/enrique-kesslerm-web/performance_webinar_notes.org][performance webinar notes.]]

* Day 17: 2021/03/24
   I moved the enriquekesslerm.com repo from the 100DaysOfGatsby to its own repo,
   with the intention of using the repository to create my future web page, which
   will contain information about me and some of my writing, getting excited! :smile:

   I had a ton of problems with the moving process, it seems that I need to adapt
   to having starter pages using a lower version of dependencies with:

   #+begin_src bash	
    npm install --force-dependencies
   #+end_src
   
   After successfully moving the project, before running out of time, I started dabbling
   into the creation of my =/about= page. I need to create a content plan before jumping
   to code.
* Day 18: 2021/03/25
   I continued working on the /about page. In order to follow good about page design
   guidelines, I created the [[file:20210325120813-about_pages.org::+title: About pages][about pages note]]. I started dabbling on the use of
   Images in gatsby, which is a spiky topic. Gatsby knows that most of the performance
   issues in modern web apps come from images, and has created a image plugin to
   take care of that, really cool.

   I created a project-show component in order to showcase some of the projects on
   the about page, half acting as a cv.
* Day 19: 2021/03/26
   As I keep on moving with the /about page, I decided on the initial design that I
   linked on previous days. You can find it [[file:about-page-poc.jpg][here.]] I started working on the gradient
   part of the text. Sparked by the initial idea, I found two interesting links:

   - https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/rainbow-button/: rainbow gradient
     transition inspiration, the idea drawing on react hooks and css variables
     is great. I adapted his work to act as a moving background for my text.
   - https://github.com/system-ui/theme-ui/discussions/1011: some information
     about how to style theme-ui components using css tags.

   With working information, I adapted Josh's work to get a working animated
   gradient text component, which I used to style my name on the /about page.

   #+CAPTION: Moving gradient name!
   #+NAME:   gradient-name
   [[./gradient-name.gif]]
* Day 20: 2021/03/27
   Already on the 20th day! I'm loving the journey and it feels like I'm getting
   more comfortable working with npm, typeScript and Gatsby overall. The project
   tree no longer feels scary.

   I continued working on the /about page, starting to create the components
   filling some of the sections. I did some more work on the project-show component,
   but I ran into some problems trying to use the theme-ui main color theme for
   "styling" the svg. Some of the links that I found useful:

   - [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61158924/import-svg-as-a-component-in-gatsby/61161331][Stack overflow answer]].
   - [[https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-react-svg/#gatsby-plugin-react-svg-npm-version][gatsby-plugin-react-svg documentation]].
* Day 21: 2021/03/28
   I continued with the structure of the /about page, with problems. I find that some
   of the posts that are supposed to be format friendly are faulty, I might need to
   restart the project again.

   Some of the problems seem to be coming from the fact that most of the dependencies are
   legacy-deps, which are not secured. I continued with the inclusions of some of the
   projects that I have been working on and tried the optimization of svgs, without success.

   Styling seems hard with the theme-ui configuration, without having our own. I need to
   figure out a way to extend the orga-theme-ui-preset with my styles, or use a min.css file.
* Day 22: 2021/03/30
   Today I kept working trying to understand the theming that is done with
   the default =orga-theme-ui-preset=. I can't seem to understand the shadowing
   of the theme. From the base *Theme-ui* documentation I see that the following
   example should work:
   #+begin_src javascript
        import orga from 'orga-theme-ui-preset/lib/index'


        export default {
          ...orga,
          links: {
            project: {
              color: 'text',
              textDecoration: 'none',
              transition: '0.3s',
              '&:hover': {
                color: 'secondary',
              }
            }
          }
     }
   #+end_src

   This code under =gatsby-plugin-theme-ui/index.js= should provide the 'project' variant
   for Links, but the styling doesn't seem to be applied. Need to do some more digging.
   Today was fun.
* Day 23: 2021/03/31
   I continued trying to tweak the custom =theme= in the starter, but
   I still don't seem to understand the way the creator intended for us to tweak
   his own theme.

   I have tried the definition of variants for some of the components that I wan't
   to create, without success. I have also tried to extend his theme by using the
   ...orga in the index file, no luck. I reached to @xiaoxinghu to clear up the fog
   a bit.
* Day 24: 2021/04/01
   I'm ready to give up, it feels like there is no progress... APRIL FOOLS!
   
   I have finally got a hang of how theme-ui styles its components. Even though
   I couldn't use variants as I would have liked, I was able to create components
   and style them individually, accessing the theme properties with the =sx= prop.

   That said, I finished the projects section in the /about page. I also started
   working on the timeline component for the /about page and finally got a working
   style. I love the initial look, I need to fill in the info soon.
