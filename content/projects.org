The enriquekesslerm.com project started as a placeholder for learning Gatsby,
entangled in the [[/100daysofgatsby-log][100 Days Of Gatsby]] experience. Built with Gatsby —easily
industry-accepted the best framework for lightning fast websites—, the site has
quickly become the place where I try to bring all of my ideas to be sure that I
keep myself learning, while creating a personal space.

** Why [[https://www.gatsbyjs.com/][Gatsby]]?
   Gatsby is a React framework, so you will have to live with that it is built
   in JavaScript. On the other side, Gatsby compensates by pre-fetching data and
   caching all your website at build time. This means that the website will feel
   as crisp as a mobile app while having all the advantages that the web still
   offers, considering how young the mobile world is.

   Gatsby provides extensive docs, and has a joyful community behind, trying to
   make the web better one step at a time. Without reinventing the wheel, you
   are able to access [[https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/][starters]], [[https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins][plugins]] and more.
   
   Considering the previous web-building experience that I had, drawing from
   some of the [[https://www.djangoproject.com/][Django]] knowledge was plenty to build the website/blog that
   I had been dreaming of. Using the =gatsby-config.js= file, you are able to
   configure plugins and the siteMetadata, which is then queryable with Graphql.

   #+begin_src javascript
    graphql`
      query SiteMetaData {
        site {
          siteMetadata {
            title
            author
            siteUrl
            description
            twitter
            social { name url }
          }
        }
      }
    `
   #+end_src

** Where is the content coming from?
   Gatsby by default —i.e. using the default starter— provides several CMS that
   you can connect to, namely Contentful, Ghost and more. I decided to go the
   more “[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][emacsy]]” route, because

   #+begin_quote
   By experimenting with voluntary discomfort, we learn to appreciate far more of
   our life, and can be content with a much simpler and more wholesome one.
   #+end_quote
   
   Instead of going for Markdown files, being a hardcore Emacs user as I am, I
   needed to find something to merge my love for Emacs and org-mode. The
   solution rested in the [[https://www.huxiaoxing.com/building-a-website-with-org-mode-files][Xiaoxing's orgajs starter]], which uses the =orgajs=
   package —also authored by him— parsing our org-mode files into beautiful and
   configurable websites, What could be better?

   Just to drive the point home, this is the magic of orgajs in play. The
   following is the heading of this post.

** Structure
   You can access the source code of this project —like any other of my
   projects— at [[https://github.com/Qkessler]], feel free to commit any changes or
   typos to help the cause.

   As I'm using the [[https://yarnpkg.com/][yarn]] package manager, the yarn.lock file keeps all the
   versions of the packages that my page requires. Under the /content directory,
   I store all the org-mode files that compose my posts. Under /src, there are
   self developed components, but Gatsby's known concept as "Shadowing" is common.
   I shadow some of the configuration files for the plugins gatsby-plugin-theme-ui
   and gatsby-theme-blorg.
