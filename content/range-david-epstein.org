Range is one of the latest books by David Epstein, who is commonly known by
giving TED talks about performance science and most recently psychology and
specialization in today's world.

We have been taught by our celebrity seeking society that success comes from
people that start out very early in their specialization topic of choice, and
through deliberate practice —a.k.a 10k hours of practice— they reach mastery
and are able to live out of it.

In this other amazing book: [[https://www.amazon.es/Early-Retirement-Extreme-philosophical-independence/dp/145360121X][Early Retirement Extreme]], Jacob Lund explains the
concept of mastery, creating a series of stages which are some of the stages we
go through in order to understand, incorporate and produce information about a
certain topic.

After years of research, we know that these cases are the extreme. Most people
that reach a certain level of "success" —What is success anyway? In my book
success is fulfillment by having the inner need of doing things right, according
to your values and the societal measures that you have been breeding over the
years— have done so by changing their path multiple times, benefiting from
the switching process. These people —again, the majority— are called the
Generalists.

* Learning environments
  When learning, having a supporting environment is key. We can classify these
  in *kind* and wicked environments. The first are the ones on which most of the
  celebrity performers thrive, as they are the ones that can benefit from hours
  of practice. Some examples are chess, golf and more.

  On the other side, *wicked* environments are the ones that no longer benefit from
  experience, hence drawing on the big picture that humans are able to bring to
  the topics. A.I is able to infer tactics for kind environments, and they are
  already good enough to beat humans at it. In order to beat the computer, our
  best bet is outsource tactics —strategies inferred after years of experience—
  while focusing on the big picture, which is contrary to specializing.

* Education
  Considering both learning environments, the Education topic had to come up.
  In our modern Education System, there are two types of professors. The
  professors that have a predisposition to give the students everything already
  prepared for them to study, and the professors that focus on problems that
  make the students think and learn on their own. The former are the ones that
  receive better reviews on the yearly polls, but guess which is better for long
  term learning?

  By creating a *wicked* learning environment, the latter are able to ensure
  that the students create the connections necessary to long term learning and
  memory. These making connection problems could also be called "Fermi
  Problems". An example of these Fermi problems (see [[https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrico_Fermi][Enrico Fermi]], he is a
  pretty cool guy) could be:
  #+begin_quote
  How many windows get cleaned each day in New York?
  #+end_quote
  The idea is that using some of the common knowledge information, i.e the
  number of people per house, or average windows per house or apartment, get an
  answer that gives an insight on our broader thinking.

* Analogical thinking
  Kepler has been famous to have thought about problems, both common and complex
  in the same way: through analogies. Analogies can spark new connections that
  we may benefit from when thinking about a problem.

  Our brains are powerful enough to withhold information, in order to avoid
  overcrowding our thoughts —our mental bandwidth. Through analogical thinking,
  our brain is able to seek patterns in the same trains of thought, hence
  helping the problems.

  Yes, striving to accomplish a single overarching goal means you have grit,
  determination and resilience. But the ability to pull yourself together mentally
  and physically in competition is different from the new challenges that await
  you. So after you retire, travel, write a poem, try to start your own business,
  stay out a little too late, devote the time to something that doesn't have a
  clear end goal.

* Foxes and Hedgehogs
  According to David, there are two types of personalities, specially in the
  information world.

  Hedgehogs are people that are usually well versed in their space of expertise,
  and have long years in the field. Instead of being able to rethink their views
  —through active open mindedness—, they are prone to sticking to their time
  funded opinions.

  Foxes on the other side, focus on facts for different themes, NOT opinions. They
  are able to differentiate the time where their views are not totally correct,
  and adapt to the situation and their current passions. Contrary to hedgehogs,
  even though they may or may not have the sufficient knowledge to cherry pick
  details to support their theory, they are comfortable with change, not being
  tied to their work as their identity.

* Tech industry
  The current trend of interesting Tech Companies is to propose a certain
  culture check in order to be able to work for the company, "just to check"
  whether you are worthy employee.

  Even though we are fed that these types of hiring processes are what sets
  apart good from bad employees, evidence shows the contrary. Cultural values,
  principles, are taught to be proportional to individual success, but it is not
  necessarily true.

  There was a recent study that showed that managers benefited from identifying
  the major cultural mode that the organization —or team— was on and pushing
  backwards based on fake Harvard Study.  This creates a movement of
  in-congruence, that keeps people on their feet, while benefiting from the
  shift of cultural processes and rethinking.

* Conclusion
  I ended up enjoying the book —I find the topic to be mesmerizing— but I did
  find it to be cumbersome to get through. Even though David succeeds at effectively
  summarizing the information, there are countless pages are not really that
  interesting.

  On the other hand, the topic of the book is one that we can benefit from these
  days, considering the push for specialization that we are seeing in the
  industry world. Maybe it is not a bad book to keep your mind fresh on the
  topic, to avoid falling on the pitfalls he mentions.

  "I would recommend score": =6/10=.
